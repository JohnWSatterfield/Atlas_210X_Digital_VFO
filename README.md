This project is a digital VFO for an Atlas 210X Amateur Radio by John Satterfield (KI5IDZ)

The VFOsysSwitch06.ino file is for the standard Atlas 5.645MHz crystal filter.  This file is readable by the Arduino IDE.  
The VFOsysSwitch07.ino file is for the Drake TR7 5.645MHz crystal filter.  This file is readable by the Arduino IDE.  
Load the file you want to use into a subdirectory of the same name and add all of the code from the libraries.  
Set the microcontroller you are using on the Arduino IDE and compile.  You can upload the files to your micricontroller from the Arduino IDE.

To download libraries click on main and select libraries.  You can now download the libraries
